# Student-Grade-Management-System
The Student Grade Management System is a console-based application implemented in C#. It allows instructors to manage and analyze student grades for multiple courses. Instructors can add students, enter grades, calculate average grades, and generate reports.

## Features
- __Add Student__: Instructors can add students by providing their name and ID. The system maintains a list of enrolled students.
- __Enter Grades__: Instructors can enter grades for students in specific courses. The system stores the grades for future calculations and reporting.
- __Calculate Average__: Instructors can calculate the average grade for a specific student based on their ID. The system retrieves the student's grades and calculates the average.
- __Generate Report__: Instructors can generate a report for a specific course, listing the students enrolled in the course and their respective grades.
- __Exit__: Instructors can exit the application when they are done managing grades.

## Getting Started
To run the Student Grade Management System, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
> git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-grade-management.git

2. Open the project in your preferred development environment (e.g., Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code).
3. Build the solution to restore dependencies and compile the application.
4. Run the application.

## Usage
The Student Grade Management System presents instructors with a menu-based interface to interact with the available features. Follow the on-screen prompts to perform specific actions, such as adding students, entering grades, calculating averages, generating reports, and exiting the application.
Please note that this is a simplified student grade management system intended for learning and practice purposes. It does not persist data and stores information in memory during runtime.
